# MasterThesis
Semantic segmentation of aerial hyperspectral images based on deep learning methods.
Basic pipeline:
Preprocessing (PCA for dimensionality reduction) -> Unsupervised feature extraction (Convolutional Autoencoder) -> Classification (SVMs).
Method described in README file, requires MATLAB with libSVM library and Torch7 for running autoenoder neural network with dependencies listed in the README.
